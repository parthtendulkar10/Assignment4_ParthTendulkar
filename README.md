## README: Assignment 4 – Hollywood Casting and Profitability ##

Title   : Hollywood Casting and Profitability
Author  : Parth Tendulkar

## Project Overview ##

This project investigates age and gender patterns in Hollywood casting and their impact on movie profitability. The analysis explores whether industry norms—like casting older men with younger women—actually correlate with better financial outcomes, or if they’re simply outdated habits.

Using a combination of casting data (including actor ages, genders, and age gaps) and financial data (budget, profit, ROI), the study quantifies the relationship between casting dynamics and commercial success.

This assignment was completed as part of ETC5512 – Wild Caught Data at Monash University and uses open-source data made available by Lynn Fisher (hollywoodagegap.com) and the GitHub repository movie-revenue-analysis by ntdoris.

## How to Use ##

This project is made for learning and exploring. It’s useful for:

- Students and teachers who want to see how data can be used to tell a story.
- People interested in movies, casting trends, or gender and age gaps in film.

The GitHub repo shows the full journey of the project — from cleaning the data to writing the blog post and styling the final report. You can read the code, check each version, and use it as a guide for your own data storytelling projects.

Please use this project responsibly. The goal is to explore patterns in a fair and respectful way, not to make judgments about individuals.

## Versioning ##

The project progressed iteratively through 5 versions. Each version was committed with meaningful changes including cleaning, joining, feature engineering, narrative drafting, and final layout polish. A summary of each version can be found in the Behind the Scenes section of the report.

## Limitations and Privacy Considerations ##

- The data is based on public sources (IMDb, box office stats), but some fields (like actor age or gender) might not be fully accurate or complete.
- The project looks at patterns, not individual movies or people — it’s meant to give a general picture, not call out specific cases.
- Actor names and film titles are used because the data is already public, but no private or sensitive information is included.
- All results are meant to be viewed at a group level — please don’t use this data to make judgments about any one actor, movie, or person.
- This analysis is for educational use only and respects the original dataset licenses.
